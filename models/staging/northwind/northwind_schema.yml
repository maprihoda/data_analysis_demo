  - name: stg_northwind_orders

    columns:

  - name: stg_northwind_products
    description: This model represents the staging table for products in the Northwind database.
    columns:
      - name: product_id
        description: "The unique identifier for each product."
        tests:
          - unique
          - not_null
      - name: supplier_id
        description: >
          SPLIT_PART(supplier_ids, ';', 1): This function splits the supplier_ids string by the delimiter ';' 
          and returns the first element of the resulting array. If the string does not contain the delimiter, 
          it returns the whole string. CAST(... AS INTEGER): This casts the result of SPLIT_PART to an integer. 
          Since only a minority of supplier_ids values contain multiple values, we opt for picking up the first one.
